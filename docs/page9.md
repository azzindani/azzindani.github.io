## Overview and Objective
This project marks the **next phase** in a multi-stage initiative that began with the development of a broker transaction data scraping system in 2022. With a solid foundation of historical broker transaction data already collected, the current focus is on building an **interactive analytics platform** to uncover **actionable insights** from that data.

The objective is to design and develop a **robust data analytics dashboard** capable of processing and analyzing broker transaction records from stock exchanges. This system will utilize **trend analysis, statistical modeling**, and **machine learning techniques** to reveal key insights such as:

* The impact of broker activity on **stock price movements**
* **Trading volume patterns** over time
* Behavioral **anomalies in broker transactions**
* Clustering brokers based on **activity similarities**

The platform will support both **historical data analysis** and **near-real-time monitoring**, enabling investors, financial analysts, and market researchers to better understand **market dynamics** and make **data-driven investment decisions**.

## Motivation and Inspiration
After successfully developing a scraping system to collect broker transaction data, the next logical step was to **turn raw data into insight**. While collecting the data provided access to critical information, meaningful patterns remained hidden in thousands of rows of unstructured records.

This project was inspired by the need to **empower users with a visual and analytical tool** that makes sense of complex broker behaviors. Drawing from my personal interest in **bandarmology** (broker-focused analysis), the project aspires to answer questions like:

* Which brokers are most influential in driving stock price trends?
* Are there coordinated buy/sell patterns across certain brokers?
* Can historical broker behavior help predict short-term market moves?

The ultimate goal is to build a **comprehensive broker analytics dashboard** that not only enhances research but also supports **smarter, faster, and more confident trading decisions** through powerful data visualizations and insights.
